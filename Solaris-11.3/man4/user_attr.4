.SH NAME
user_attr \- extended user attributes database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/user_attr\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/user_attr\fR is a local source of extended attributes associated with users and roles. \fBuser_attr\fR can be used with other user attribute sources, including the LDAP people container and the \fBuser_attr\fR \fBNIS\fR map. Programs use the \fBgetuserattr\fR(3C) routines to gain access to this information.
.sp
.LP
The search order for multiple \fBuser_attr\fR sources is specified in the \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file, as described in the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) man page. The search order follows that for \fBpasswd\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBuser_attr\fR databases consists of a single line with five fields separated by colons (\fB:\fR). Line continuations using the backslash (\fB\e\fR) character are permitted. Each entry has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIuser\fR:\fIqualifier\fR:\fIres1\fR:\fIres2\fR:\fIattr\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIuser\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The name of the user as specified in the \fBpasswd\fR(4) database.

\fB\fIqualifier\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An optional field specifying a hostname or a netgroup name which qualifies where the extended attributes are applicable. The prefix \fB@\fR is required to indicate that the value is a netgroup. This field is only interpreted by the LDAP name service, in which case the user or role may be assigned multiple \fBuser_attr\fR entries. The precedence for retrieving a user's entry is to first look for the user's entry which explicitly matches the current hostname, then to look for the user's entry with a netgroup name matching the current hostname. An unqualified entry has the lowest precedence.

\fB\fBaccess_times\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma-separated rules that specify the days and times that the corresponding set of applications and services can be accessed. An asterisk is treated as a wildcard, which matches any service name. When evaluating the \fBaccess_times\fR for a specific service, if no entries are found then the user is exempt from time restrictions for that service. The syntax is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
{<service>,...}:<days><start>-<end>[/<days><start>-<end>...
[,{<service>,...}:<days><start>-<end>]...
.fi
.in -2

Lists of one or more service names are enclosed in curly braces, followed by the corresponding time policy. The valid days are specified by a sequence of undelimitted two character entries from the set:
.sp
\fBMo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al\fR
.sp
The last three indicating the weekdays, the weekend and all 7 days to the week, respectively. The time-range is two 24-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and end times. Generally, one range can be specified per day. However, an end time less than the start time applies to the following day.
.sp
Multiple specifications of days and times are separated by a slash. Multiple sets of rules are separated by a comma.

Contains an ordered, comma-separated list of profile names chosen from \fBprof_attr\fR(4). The process attributes of commands included in this list of profiles are applied via \fBexec\fR(2) if the process flag \fBPRIV_PFEXEC\fR is enabled. See \fBpfexec\fR(1).
.sp
A list of profiles can also be defined in the \fB/etc/security/policy.conf\fR file. See \fBpolicy.conf\fR(4). If no profiles are assigned, the profile shells do not allow the user to execute any commands.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Contains one of two keywords that the Trusted Extensions window manager interprets when a workstation is idle for too long. The keyword \fBlock\fR specifies that the workstation is to be locked (thus requiring the user to re-authenticate to resume the session). The keyword \fBlogout\fR specifies that session is to be terminated (thus, killing the user's processes launched in the current session). If unspecified, the default value, \fBlock\fR, is in effect.

Except for the \fBtype\fR key, the \fB\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR\fR fields in the \fBuser_attr\fR database can be added using \fBroleadd\fR(1M) and \fBuseradd\fR(1M). You can use \fBrolemod\fR(1M) and \fBusermod\fR(1M) to modify these values. Modification of the \fBtype\fR key is restricted as described in \fBrolemod\fR and \fBusermod\fR.
.sp
.LP
The values assigned to the \fBaccess_times\fR, \fBauths\fR, \fBauth_profiles\fR, \fBroles\fR, and \fBprofiles\fR keywords are cumulative. To assign the values, \fB/etc/user_attr\fR is searched first, followed by each of the profiles, in order. The other keywords (\fBaudit_flags, project, access_tz, defaultpriv, limitpriv, lock_after_retries, idletime, idlecmd, pam_policy, clearance\fR and \fBmin_label\fR) are first matched, meaning that \fB/etc/user_attr\fR is searched first, followed by each of the profiles, in order. Once a match is found that search is over.
.SS "Privileges Keywords"
.sp
.LP
See \fBprivileges\fR(5) for a description of privileges. The command \fBppriv\fR \fB-l\fR (see \fBppriv\fR(1)) produces a list of all supported privileges. You specify privileges as they are displayed by \fBppriv\fR. In \fBprivileges\fR(5), privileges are listed in the form \fBPRIV_\fR\fI<privilege_name>\fR\&. For example, the privilege \fBfile_chown\fR, as you would specify it in \fBuser_attr\fR, is listed in \fBprivileges\fR(5) as \fBPRIV_FILE_CHOWN\fR.
.sp
.LP
Privileges can be specified through \fBusermod\fR(1M)and \fBrolemod\fR(1M). See \fBusermod\fR(1M) for examples of commands that modify privileges and their subsequent effect on \fBuser_attr\fR.

The \fBsolaris.auth.assign\fR authorization allows an authorized user to grant any authorization to another user. The \fBsolaris.auth.delegate\fR allows an authorized user to grant only the user's authorizations to another user. The same principle applies to \fBroles\fR, \fBprofiles\fR, \fBprivileges\fR, and \fBproject\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBclearance\fR and \fBmin_label\fR values can only be set based on the authorized user's label range. The \fBdefaultpriv\fR and \fBlimitpriv\fR values can only be set based on the authorized user's granted \fBdefaultpriv\fR and \fBlimitpriv\fR privileges.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAssigning a Profile to Root
.sp
.LP
The following example entry assigns to \fBroot\fR the \fBAll\fR profile, which allows root to use all commands in the system, and also assigns all authorizations:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
root::::auths=solaris.*;profiles=All;type=normal
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBsolaris.*\fR wildcard authorization gives \fBroot\fR all of the \fBsolaris\fR authorizations. See \fBauth_attr\fR(4) for more about authorizations.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRSpecifying the Time Rules for PAM Services
.sp
.LP
The following example entry specifies the days and times when specific PAM services are available to a user:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
jdoe::::access_tz=US/Pacific;access_times={pfexec,sudo}\:\
MoWe0900-1730/Sa2200-0200,{*}\:Wk0800-2200;auth_profiles=\
File System Management;
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The user \fBjdoe\fR is restricted to use the File System Management profile or to use \fBsudo\fR(1M) on Mondays and Wednesdays between 9:00 AM and 5:30 PM, and from 10 PM on Saturdays until 2 AM the following morning. All other PAM services are available on weekdays from 8 AM to 10 PM. These times are all interpreted using the US/Pacific time zone.

.sp
.LP
Although the colon character must be escaped with a backslash in the \fBuser_attr\fR entry, the backslash is not used with the administrative interfaces, e.g. \fBusermod\fR(1M) and \fBprofiles\fR(1). However, quotes are required to prevent the shell from interpreting other special characters like asterisk, braces, and blanks.

.sp

The above entry could have been created using the following commands:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The root user is usually defined in local databases for a number of reasons, including the fact that root needs to be able to log in and do system maintenance in single-user mode, before the network name service databases are available. For this reason, an entry should exist for root in the local \fBuser_attr\fR file, and the precedence shown in the example \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) file entry under EXAMPLES is highly recommended.
.sp
.LP
Because the list of legal keys is likely to expand, any code that parses this database must be written to ignore unknown key-value pairs without error. When any new keywords are created, the names should be prefixed with a unique string, such as the company's stock symbol, to avoid potential naming conflicts.
.sp
.LP
This file should not be edited. Values are changed using \fBuseradd\fR(1M) and \fBusermod\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
A user without an entry in \fBuser_attr\fR gets the default values as defined in \fB/etc/security/policy.conf\fR.
