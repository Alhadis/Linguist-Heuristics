.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/shells\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBshells\fR file contains a list of the shells on the system. Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is valid. See \fBgetusershell\fR(3C). For each shell a single line should be present, consisting of the shell's path, relative to root.
.sp
.LP
A hash mark (\fB#\fR) indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by the routines which search the file. Blank lines are also ignored.
.sp
.LP
The following default shells are used by utilities: \fB/bin/bash\fR, \fB/bin/csh\fR, \fB/bin/jsh\fR, \fB/bin/ksh\fR, \fB/bin/ksh93\fR, \fB/bin/pfcsh\fR, \fB/bin/pfksh\fR, \fB/bin/pfsh\fR, \fB/bin/sh\fR, \fB/bin/tcsh\fR, \fB/bin/zsh\fR, \fB/sbin/jsh\fR, \fB/sbin/sh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/bash\fR, \fB/usr/bin/csh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/jsh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/ksh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/ksh93\fR, \fB/usr/bin/pfcsh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/pfksh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/pfsh\fR, and \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/tcsh\fR, \fB/usr/bin/zsh\fR, and \fB/usr/sfw/bin/zsh\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/shells\fR file overrides the list of valid shells on the system. For each shell, a single line should be present consisting of the shell's absolute path. A hash mark (\fB#\fR) indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted. Blank lines are also ignored.

.LP
Applications can access the list of shells through \fBgetusershell\fR(3C). If \fB/etc/shells\fR is not present, the default list of valid shells is:
