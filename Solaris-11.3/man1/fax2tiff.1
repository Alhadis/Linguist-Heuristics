.SH "NAME"
fax2tiff \- create
a TIFF Class F fax file from raw fax data
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBfax2tiff\fR [\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR] [-\fBo \fIoutput\&.tif\fR\fR] \fB\fIinput\&.g3\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfax2tiff\fR creates a TIFF file containing CCITT Group
3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files containing "raw"
Group 3 encoded data, typically obtained directly from a fax modem\&.
.PP
By default, each row of data in the resultant TIFF file is 2-dimensionally
encoded and padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as needed\&. The resultant image
is a set of low resolution (98 lines per inch) or medium resolution (196 lines
per inch) pages, each of which is a single strip of data\&. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Input Data Options"
.PP
The following input data options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB2\fR\fR
.in +16n

Assume input
data is 2-d Huffman encoded\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2

\fB-\fBB\fR\fR
.in +16n

data was encoded with black as 0 and white as 1\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBL\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Treat input data
as having bits filled from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant
bit (MSB)\&. This is the default\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBM\fR\fR

bit (LSB)\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBR\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Specify the vertical
resolution, in lines per inch, of the input images\&. By default, input images
are assumed to have a vertical resolution of 196 lines per inch\&. If images
are low resolution facsimile, specify a value of 98 lines per inch\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2

.SS "Output File Options"
.PP
The following output file options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB1\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Force output
to be compressed with the 1-dimensional version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman
encoding algorithm\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB4\fR\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBp\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Force the last
bit of each End Of Line (EOL) code to land on a byte boundary\&. This "zero
padding" is reflected in the contents of the Group3Options tag of the
resultant TIFF file\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2

\fB-\fBs\fR\fR
.in +16n

Force \fBfax2tiff\fR
to print the number of rows of data retrieved from the input file\&.
.sp

.SH "OPERANDS"
.PP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB\fB\fIinput\&.g3\fR\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
The name of the input file that contains raw fax data\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The generated file conforms to the TIFF Class F (FAX) specification
for storing facsimile data\&. This means, in particular, that each page of the
data does not include the trailing return to control (RTC) code, as required
for transmission by the CCITT Group 3 specifications\&. The old, "classic"
format is created if the -\fBc\fR option is used\&. The Class F format
can also be requested with the -\fBf\fR option\&.
.PP
The default name of the output image is \fBfax\&.tif\fR\&.
You can use the -\fBo\fR option to change the output filename\&.
.PP
Each input file is assumed to be a separate page of facsimile data from
the same document\&. The order in which input files are specified on the command
line is the order in which the resultant pages appear in the output file\&.
.SS "Diagnostics"
.PP
The following warnings and errors come from the decoding routines in
the library\&.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fBWarning, %s: Premature EOL at scanline %d (x %d)\&.\n\&.\fR
.in +24n
.rt
The input data had a row that was shorter than the expected
value of 1728\&. The row is padded with white\&.

.in -24n
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB%s: Premature EOF at scanline %d (x %d)\&.\n\&.\fR
.in +24n

row is padded with white\&.

.in +24n

The row number and horizontal position is given\&. The remainder of the input
row is discarded, while the corresponding output row is padded with white\&.
