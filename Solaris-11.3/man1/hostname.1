.SH NAME
hostname \- set or print name of current host system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/hostname\fR [[\fB-t\fR] \fIname-of-host\fR]
.fi

\fB/usr/bin/hostname\fR [\fB-D\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhostname\fR command prints the name of the current host, as given before the \fBlogin\fR prompt. The super-user can set the hostname by giving an argument. The change of the hostname is permanent unless the \fB-t\fR option is specified.
.sp
.LP
By default, any system configured as a DHCP client will use the hostname returned by DHCP as its hostname. This default behavior is altered once the hostname is set manually using the \fBhostname\fR command.  The \fB-D\fR option can be used to return the system back to the default behavior so that any DHCP client hostname will be given precedence over the manually defined hostname. Note that this default behavior may change in a future Solaris release and the semantics of the \fB-D\fR option might change to reflect any such change.
