.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrtw\fR \fI802.11b\fR wireless NIC driver is a  multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based  STREAMS driver supporting RealTek 8180L chipset-based NIC's.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrtw\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported \fI802.11b\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. The default is 11. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBrtw\fR driver supports only BSS  networks  (also  known as \fBap\fR or \fBinfrastructure\fR networks) and \fBopen\fR (or \fBopen-system\fR) or \fBshared system\fR authentication.
