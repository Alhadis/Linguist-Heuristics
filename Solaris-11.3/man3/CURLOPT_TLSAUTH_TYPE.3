.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE, long bitmask);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter, which is set to a bitmask, to tell libcurl which
authentication method(s) you want it to use for TLS authentication.

.IP CURL_TLSAUTH_SRP
TLS-SRP authentication. Secure Remote Password authentication for TLS is
defined in RFC5054 and provides mutual authentication if both sides have a
shared secret. To use TLS-SRP, you must also set the
\fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD(3)\fP
options.
.SH DEFAULT
CURL_TLSAUTH_NONE (0)
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS-based protocols
.SH EXAMPLE
TODO

You need to build libcurl with GnuTLS or OpenSSL with TLS-SRP support for this
to work. Added in 7.21.4
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
