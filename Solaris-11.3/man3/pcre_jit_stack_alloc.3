.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function is used to create a stack for use by the code compiled by the JIT
optimization of \fBpcre[16|32]_study()\fP. The arguments are a starting size for
the stack, and a maximum size to which it is allowed to grow. The result can be
passed to the JIT run-time code by \fBpcre[16|32]_assign_jit_stack()\fP, or that
function can set up a callback for obtaining a stack. A maximum stack size of
512K to 1M should be more than enough for any pattern. For more details, see
the

page.
