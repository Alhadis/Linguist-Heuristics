.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This convenience function finds the number of a named substring capturing
parenthesis in a compiled pattern. Its arguments are:
.sp
  \fIcode\fP    Compiled regular expression
  \fIname\fP    Name whose number is required
.sp
The yield of the function is the number of the parenthesis if the name is
found, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING otherwise. When duplicate names are allowed
(PCRE_DUPNAMES is set), it is not defined which of the numbers is returned by
\fBpcre[16|32]_get_stringnumber()\fP. You can obtain the complete list by calling
\fBpcre[16|32]_get_stringtable_entries()\fP.
