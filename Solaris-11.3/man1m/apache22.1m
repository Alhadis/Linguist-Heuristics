.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2 (Apache 2) consists of a main  server daemon,
loadable server modules,  some additional  support utilities, configuration
files, and documentation.
.sp
.LP
Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the servers are installed. It also
includes two of the most popular MPMs - Prefork and Worker.
.sp
Apache 2 can be enabled by authorized user within the service
management facility (SMF), using the following fault management
resource identifier (FMRI):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/http:apache22
.fi
.in -2
.sp
Available SMF properties are listed in the following table:
.sp

tab(^G) allbox;
cw(2.750000i)| cw(2.750000i)
lw(2.750000i)| lw(2.750000i).
SMF Property Name^Value 
httpd/server_type^prefork (default) or worker 
httpd/enable_64bit^true or false(default)
httpd/startup_options^valid apachectl options

Contains server configuration files. A newly-installed server
contains a default \fBhttpd.conf\fR file. This is the main configuration file.
.sp
If there is need to use different main configuration file (e.g. to run
multiple Apache 2 instances), it's possible by providing Apache '-f'
option via SMF property httpd/startup_options.

By default, server will load all the \fB\&.conf\fR files
placed under this directory. It also has 2 additional \fB\&.load\fR configuration
files-\fBmodules-32.load\fR and \fBmodules-64.load\fR which
contain \fBLoadModule\fR directives for loading the 32 and 64-bit
bundled Apache 2 modules respectively.

.RS 4n
File for specifying the environment settings which the server uses at
startup. This is the user-editable version of the 
/usr/apache2/[version]/bin/envvars file. 
.sp
Note that this is default path to envvars file only in case where main
configuration file is in directory /etc/apache2/[version]/. If this
is not the case Apache 2 will look for envvars file in the same
directory where is main configuration file.
