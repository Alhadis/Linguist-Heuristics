.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdnssec-dsfromkey\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-1\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use \fBSHA-1\fR as the digest algorithm. The default is to use both \fBSHA-1\fR and \fBSHA-256\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-2\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use SHA-256 as the digest algorithm.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIalgorithm\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Select the digest algorithm. The value of \fIalgorithm\fR must be one of \fBSHA-1\fR (\fBSHA1\fR) or \fBSHA-256\fR (\fBSHA256\fR). These values are case-insensitive.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR \fIlevel\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the debugging level.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a keyset file. The \fB-c\fR and \fB-d\fR options have meaning only in this mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the DNS class (default is \fBIN\fR); useful only  in the keyset mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdirectory\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Look for keyset files in directory as the directory; ignored when not in the keyset mode.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
To build the SHA-256 DS RR from the \fBKexample.com.+003+26160\fR keyfile name, use a command such as the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBdnssec-dsfromkey -2 Kexample.com.+003+26160\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This command would produce output similar to the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example.com. IN DS 26160 5 2

3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
The keyfile can be designated by the key identification \fBK\fR\fInnnn\fR.+\fIaaa\fR+\fIiiiii\fR, or the full file name \fBK\fInnnn\fR.+\fIaaa\fR+\fIiiiii\fR.key\fR, as generated by \fBdnssec-keygen\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The keyset file name is built from the directory, the string \fBkeyset-\fR and the \fIdnsname\fR.
