# There actually isn't a `master` branch

The main branch is called [`misc`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/misc),
and it's where searches are logged if they're too trivial to warrant their own branch.

I added this as a dummy branch to stop myself accidentally pushing new repos and publishing
a remote named `master`. Incidentally, there's a strange abundance of `*.master` files on
GitHub, most of which with unknown languages.

Might be worth a look sometime, perhaps not.
