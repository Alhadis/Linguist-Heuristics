libatk-1\&.0 \- Accessibility Toolkit API
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ATK (Accessibility Tool Kit) is a set of interfaces which, when implemented by
applications and user-interface component libraries, supports the use of
applications by persons with disabilities\&.  ATK provides a consistent set of
in-process interfaces which conforming components implement, either directly or
via the use of add-on libraries\&. These interfaces are in turn exported
out-of-process for use by assistive technologies (see
\fBat-spi\fR(3))\&. 
.PP
Using ATK, applications can explicitly provide descriptive information about
their components\&. By using ATK-enabled toolkits such as GTK+, applications
obtain built-in accessibility support\&.
.PP
The ATK API is a queryable, interfaced API for obtaining textual,
attribute-based, and coordinate information from user interface components, and
also provides a means of activating and interacting with those components
without the direct use of the keyboard or system pointing device\&.
.PP
To access the API documentation, you must install the developer version of the
package\&.
