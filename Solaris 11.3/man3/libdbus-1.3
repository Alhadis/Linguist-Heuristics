libdbus-1, libdbus-glib-1 \- D\-Bus Library and GLib bindings
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
D\-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one
another\&.  The \fBlibdbus-1\fR library provides low-level API\&.
The \fBdbus-glib-1\fR library provides C-language bindings for using
D\-Bus with a higher-level approach\&.  The higher level approach is possible
because GLib defines a main loop, an object/type system, and an out-of-memory
handling policy (it exits the program)\&.
.PP
D\-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
device added" or "printer queue changed") and a
per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications)\&.
Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing
framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without
going through the message bus daemon)\&.
.PP
The D\-Bus API isn\&'t finished yet, and the design is by no means set in stone\&.
One of our main goals is for lots of projects to use it, so if you would not
use it, by all means mail us and say why - design, licensing, indentation
style, we would rather know than not know\&.
