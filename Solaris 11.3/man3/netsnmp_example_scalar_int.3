.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
This example merely creates some scalar registrations that allows some simple variables to be accessed via SNMP.
.PP
In a more realistic example, it is likely that these variables would also be manipulated in other ways outside of SNMP gets/sets.
.PP
If this module is compiled into an agent, you should be able to issue snmp commands that look something like (authentication information not shown in these commands):
.PP
snmpget localhost netSnmpExampleInteger.0 netSnmpExampleScalars = 42
.PP
snmpset localhost netSnmpExampleInteger.0 = 1234 netSnmpExampleScalars = 1234
.PP
snmpget localhost netSnmpExampleInteger.0 netSnmpExampleScalars = 1234
