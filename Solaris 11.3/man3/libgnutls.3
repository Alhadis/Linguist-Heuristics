.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
GnuTLS is a modern C library that implements the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications\&.

It provides a secure layer, over a reliable transport layer\&. 
Currently the GnuTLS library implements the proposed standards by the 
IETF\&'s TLS working group\&.

A number of projects in Solaris Desktop such as Evolution, Pidgin,
Ekiga and Vino depend on it\&.
