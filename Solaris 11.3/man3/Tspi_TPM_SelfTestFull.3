.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_SelfTestFull\fR
assures that the TPM is functioning as designed. For FIPS certification,
crypto modules are required to test themselves before they are used, and
this command is used to fulfill that requirement. This command can also be
used to check the TPM whenever such a check is desired. \fBThis command is not
currently implemented\fR.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
.SS hTPM
The \fIhTPM\fR parameter is used to specify the handle of the TPM object on
which the self-tests will be run.

.SH "RETURN CODES"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_GetStatus\fR returns TSS_SUCCESS on success, otherwise one of
the following values is returned:
.TP
.SM TSS_E_INVALID_HANDLE
\fIhTPM\fR is not a valid handle.

.TP
.SM TSS_E_INTERNAL_ERROR
An internal SW error has been detected.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"

.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_SelfTestFull\fR conforms to the Trusted Computing Group
Software Specification version 1.1 Golden
