libgcrypt \- libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlibgcrypt\fR is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG\&. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, Twofish, Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting functions\&.
