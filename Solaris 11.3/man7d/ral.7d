.SH NAME
ral \- Ralink RT2500 802.11b/g Wireless driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBral\fR \fI802.11b/g\fR wireless NIC driver is a  multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based  STREAMS driver supporting Ralink RT2500 chipset-based NIC's.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBral\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported \fI802.11b\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported \fI802.11g\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec. The \fBral\fR driver supports only BSS  networks (also  known as \fBap\fR or \fBinfrastructure\fR networks) and \fBopen\fR (or \fBopen-system\fR) or \fBshared system\fR authentication.
