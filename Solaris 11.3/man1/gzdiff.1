.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Gzcmp
and

are used to invoke the
.I cmp
or the

program on files compressed via
.IR gzip "."
All options specified are passed directly to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are
.I file1
and an uncompressed
.IR file1 ".gz."
If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
The exit status from
.I cmp
or
.I diff
is preserved.
