.SH NAME
psmerge \- filter to merge several PostScript files into one
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psmerge 
[
.B \-o\fIout.ps\fB
]
[
.I file.ps ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Psmerge
merges PostScript documents into a single document. It only works in the
specific case the the files were created using the same application, with the
same device setup and resources (fonts, procsets, patterns, files, etc)
loaded.

If the
.B \-o
option is used, output will be sent to the file named, otherwise it will go to
standard output.

.I Psmerge
will merge multiple files concatenated into a single file as if they
were in separate files.
