dbus-launch \- Utility to start a message bus from a shell script
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBdbus-launch\fR [-\fB-auto-syntax\fR] [-\fB-config-file=\fIfilename\fR\fR] [-\fB-close-stderr\fR] [-\fB-csh-syntax\fR] [-\fB-exit-with-session\fR] [-\fB-help\fR] [-\fB-sh-syntax\fR] [-\fB-version\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBdbus-launch\fR command is used to start a session bus instance of
\fBdbus-daemon\fR from a shell script\&.  It would normally be
called from a user\&'s login scripts\&.  Unlike the daemon itself,
\fBdbus-launch\fR exits, so backticks or the $() construct can be used
to read information from \fBdbus-launch\fR\&.
.PP
With no arguments, \fBdbus-launch\fR will launch a session bus instance
and print the address and pid of that instance to standard output\&.
.PP
You may specify a program to be run; in this case, \fBdbus-launch\fR
will launch a session bus instance, set the appropriate environment variables
so the specified program can find the bus, and then execute the specified
program, with the specified arguments\&.  See below for examples\&.
.PP
If you launch a program, \fBdbus-launch\fR will not print the
information about the new bus to standard output\&.
.PP
When \fBdbus-launch\fR prints bus information to standard output, by
default it is in a simple key-value pairs format\&.  However, you may request
several alternate syntaxes using the -\fB-sh-syntax\fR,
-\fB-csh-syntax\fR, -\fB-binary-syntax\fR, or
-\fB-auto-syntax\fR options\&.  Several of these cause
\fBdbus-launch\fR to emit shell code to set up the environment\&.
.PP
With the -\fB-auto-syntax\fR option, \fBdbus-launch\fR looks
at the value of the SHELL environment variable to determine which shell syntax
should be used\&.  If SHELL ends in "csh", then csh-compatible code is
emitted; otherwise Bourne shell code is emitted\&.  Instead of passing
-\fB-auto-syntax\fR, you may explicity specify a particular one by
using -\fB-sh-syntax\fR for Bourne syntax, or
-\fB-csh-syntax\fR for csh syntax\&.  In scripts, it is more robust to
avoid -\fB-auto-syntax\fR and you hopefully know which shell your
script is written in\&.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.SS "AUTOMATIC LAUNCHING"
.PP
If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is not set for a process that tries to use D\-Bus,
by default the process will attempt to invoke \fBdbus-launch\fR with the
-\fB-autolaunch\fR option to start up a new session bus or find the
existing bus address on the X display or in a file in
\fB~/\&.dbus/session-bus/\fR\&.
.PP
Whenever an autolaunch occurs, the application that had to start a new bus will
be in its own little world; it can effectively end up starting a whole new
session if it tries to use a lot of bus services\&. This can be suboptimal or
even totally broken, depending on the application and what it tries to do\&.
.PP
There are two common reasons for autolaunch\&. One is
\fBssh\fR(1)
to a remote machine\&.  The ideal fix for that would be forwarding of
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in the same way that DISPLAY is forwarded\&.  In the
meantime, you can edit the \fBsession\&.conf\fR config file to
have your session bus listen on TCP, and manually set
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, if you like\&.
.PP
The second common reason for autolaunch is an
\fBsu\fR(1m)\&.
to another user, and display of X applications running as the second user on
the display belonging to the first user\&. Perhaps the ideal fix in this case
would be to allow the second user to connect to the session bus of the first
user, just as they can connect to the first user\&'s display\&.  However, a
mechanism for that has not been coded\&.
.PP
You can always avoid autolaunch by manually setting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\&.
Autolaunch happens because the default address (if none is set) is
"autolaunch:", so if any other address is set there will be no
autolaunch\&.  You can however include autolaunch in an explicit session bus
address as a fallback, for example
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="something:,autolaunch:" - in that case if
the first address doesn\&'t work, processes will auto- launch\&. (The bus address
variable contains a comma-separated list of addresses to try\&.)
.PP
The -\fB-autolaunch\fR option is considered an internal
implementation detail of libdbus, and in fact there are plans to change it\&.
There is no real reason to use it outside of the libdbus implementation anyhow\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-autolaunch=\fImachineid\fR\fR\fR
.sp .6
.in +4
This option implies that \fBdbus-launch\fR should scan for a
previously-started session and reuse the values found there\&.  If no session is
found, it will start a new session\&.  The -\fB-exit-with-session\fR
option is implied if -\fB-autolaunch\fR is given\&.  This option is for
the exclusive use of libdbus, you do not want to use it manually\&.  It may
change in the future\&.
.sp
.sp 1

\fB-\fB-auto-syntax\fR\fR

the SHELL environment variable\&.
.sp
.sp 1

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-binary-syntax\fR\fR
.sp .6
.in +4
Write to \fBstdout\fR a null-terminated bus address, then the bus
PID as a binary integer of size sizeof(pid_t), then the bus X window ID as a
binary integer of size sizeof(long)\&.  Integers are in the machine\&'s byte order,
not network byte order or any other canonical byte order\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -4
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-close-stderr\fR\fR
.sp .6
.in +4
Close the standard error output stream before starting the D\-Bus daemon\&.  This
is useful if you want to capture \fBdbus-launch\fR error messages but
you do not want \fBdbus\-daemon\fR to keep the stream open to your
application\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -4
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-config-file=\fIfilename\fR\fR\fR
.sp .6
.in +4
Pass -\fB-config-file=\fIfilename\fR\fR to the
bus daemon, instead of passing it the -\fB-session\fR argument\&.  See
the man page for \fBdbus\-daemon\fR\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -4
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-csh-syntax\fR\fR

.sp
.sp 1
.in -4
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fB-exit-with-session\fR\fR
.sp .6
.in +4
If this option is provided, a persistent "babysitter" process will be
created that watches \fBstdin\fR for HUP and tries to connect to
the X server\&.  If this process gets a HUP on \fBstdin\fR or loses
its X connection, it kills the message bus daemon\&.

the per-session bus daemon\fR

.nf
       ## test for an existing bus daemon, just to be safe
       if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then

           eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`

The above would likely be appropriate for \fB~/\&.xsession\fR or

The address of the login session message bus\&.  If this variable is not set,
applications may also try to read the address from the X Window System root
window property _DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\&.  The root window property
must have type STRING\&.  The environment variable should have precedence over the root window property\&.
