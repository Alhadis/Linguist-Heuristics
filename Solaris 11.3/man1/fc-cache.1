.SH NAME
fc-cache \- build font information cache files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBfc-cache\fR [ \fB-fsvVh\fR ]  [ \fB--force\fR ]  [ \fB--system-only\fR ]  [ \fB--verbose\fR ]  [ \fB--version\fR ]  [ \fB--help\fR ]  [ \fB\fIdir\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfc-cache\fR scans the font directories on
the system and builds font information cache files for
applications using fontconfig for their font handling.
.PP
If directory arguments are not given,
\fBfc-cache\fR uses each directory in the
current font configuration. Each directory is scanned for
font files readable by FreeType. A cache is created which
contains properties of each font and the associated filename.
This cache is used to speed up application startup when using
the fontconfig library.
.PP
Note that \fBfc-cache\fR must be executed
once per architecture to generate font information customized
for that architecture.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax,
with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of
options is included below.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Force re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache files,
overriding the timestamp checking.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Only scan system-wide directories, omitting the places
located in the user's home directory.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Display status information while busy.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Show version of the program and exit.
.TP
\fB\fIdir\fB\fR
Directory to scan for fonts.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI%cachdir%/*-%arch%\&.cache-2\fB\fR
These files are generated by \fBfc-cache\fR
and contain maps from file names to font properties. They are
read by the fontconfig library at application startup to locate
appropriate fonts.

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBfc-cache\fR is run automatically at system boot to ensure font caches are
up to date via the \fBfc-cache\fR service.
The \fBfc-cache\fR service is managed by the service management facility, 
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.PP
.nf
svc:/application/font/fc-cache
.fi
.PP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or 
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M)\&. 
The service\&'s status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command\&.
