			one more thing, then why not remove this troubling tree?
				--> inferred( God wants this tree to be taken good care of )
				--> maybe( God wants the tree of knowledge of good&evil to evolve )
			another possibility is that good&evil is like a module to a program
			and God just forgot to disable it, or found it hard to disable it
