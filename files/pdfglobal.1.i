  Program:      PDFglobal.i
  
  Written By:   Gordon Campbell
  Written On:   January 2004
  
  Description:  Defines the temp-tables and other Global-type requirements
  
  06/03/04  G Campbell  Added res_len to TT_Resource table
  
  06/03/04  G Campbell  Added preprocessor PDFDIR to handle application 
                        directories.  Ensure that the proprocessor has a 
                        forward slash at the end of the directory:
                        
                        eg: GOOD -- /gord/pdfinclude/
                            BAD  -- /gord/pdfinclude
                            
                        Or you can leave it blank to run as is.
                        
  06/15/04  G Campbell  Changed PDFDIR from Scoped to Global preprocessor

  06/15/04  G Campbell  Added  TT_pdf_xml temp-table.
  
  06/16/04  G Campbell  Added fields to TT_Font that will handle the Encoding 
                        and FontFile3 elements in a Font Dictionary.

  06/17/04  G Campbell  Added pdf_id identifier to TT_object.  This allows
                        separation of the Object Pointers by the individual
                        PDF file.

  06/23/04  G Campbell  Added obj_stream index to TT_Object
  
  07/07/04  G Campbell  Added temp-table TT_Widget.  This stores the info
                        pertaining to an Adobe Form Field. 

  07/30/04  G Campbell  Added widget_page to the TT_Widget temp-table.  This 
                        allows us to track which page the widget actually 
                        belongs on.  Useful when using a multi-page PDF 
                        template.

  09/13/04  G Campbell  Added the Rotate field to TT_Object.  This allowed me
                        to store how the PDF template was created (rotated).  A
                        landscape document in Word is typically rotate 90 
                        degrees, while portrait docs are typically rotate = 0.

  10/07/04  G Campbell  Added res_old to TT_Resource table

                        Added obj_mediaN to TT_Object table.

  01/25/05  G Campbell  Added uni_obj and uni_gen for ToUnicode dictionary

                        Added descend_obj and descend_gen for DescendatnFonts
                        dictionary

  04/14/05  G Campbell  Added obj_CropN to accommodate specific object CropBox
                        behaviour

  07/06/05  G Campbell  Added pdf_pre.i to set preprocessor definitions
                        Added h_PDFinc handle -- removed from pdf_inc.i

  09/22/05  G Campbell  Added page_id to TT_Font.  This will track with which
                        external page a Font was added in.

  01/06/06  G Campbell  Added font_base to the TT_Font table.  Indicates 
                        the BaseFont name of the external font.

  03/03/10  JC Cardot   Added a bunch of new fields to TT_pdf_object in order to
                        implement pdfExtract v2

  01/16/11  JC Cardot   Added used_flag to the TT_Font table.  Indicates that
                        the font must be present in the pdf ressources

  06/19/11  JC Cardot   Added TT_Widget.widget_tpos to store the position
                        of the text within the fillin

  08/23/12  JC Cardot   Added various fields to tt_widget to manage checkboxes,
                        radio buttons, combo & list boxes

  10/04/13  JC Cardot   Added fields to TT_pdf_ext to store the array & dict seq used
  
  03/26/15  JC Cardot   Move pdf_pre.i to inc
