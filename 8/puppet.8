.SH DESCRIPTION

This document is intended as a secondary reference only.  Please refer to the complete documentation on the
.B puppet
website:
.PP
\h"4"http://www.reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/DocumentationStart
.PP
Every 
.B puppet
executable (with the exception of 
.B puppetdoc
) accepts all of the arguments below, but not all of the arguments make sense for every executable. Each argument has a section listed with it in parentheses; often, that section will map to an executable (e.g., 
.B puppetd
), in which case it probably only makes sense for that one executable. If 
.B puppet
is listed as the section, it is most likely an option that is valid for everyone.
.PP
This will not always be the case. I have tried to be as thorough as possible in the descriptions of the arguments, so it should be obvious whether an argument is appropriate or not.
.PP
These arguments can be supplied to the executables either as command-line arugments or in the configuration file for the appropriate executable. For instance, the command-line invocation below would set the configuration directory to /private/puppet:
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --confdir=/private/puppet
.PP
Note that boolean options are turned on and off with a slightly different syntax on the command line:
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --storeconfigs
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --no-storeconfigs
.PP
The invocations above will enable and disable, respectively, the storage of the client configuration.
.PP
As mentioned above, the configuration parameters can also be stored in a configuration file located in the configuration directory (/etc/puppet by default). The file is called puppet.conf.
.PP
The file, which follows INI-style formatting, should contain a bracketed heading named for each executable, followed by pairs of parameters with their values. Here is an example of a very simple puppet.conf file:
.PP
\h"4"[puppetd]
.br
\h"4"confdir = /private/puppet
.br
\h"4"storeconfigs = true
.br
.PP
Note that boolean parameters must be explicitly specified as true or false as seen above.
.PP
If you're starting out with a fresh configuration, you may wish to let the executable generate a template configuration file for you by invoking the executable in question with the --genconfig command. The executable will print a template configuration to standard output, which can be redirected to a file like so:
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --genconfig > /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
.PP
Note that this invocation will "clobber" (throw away) the contents of any pre-existing puppet.conf file, so make a backup of your present config if it contains valuable information.
.PP
Like the --genconfig argument, the executables also accept a --genmanifest argument, which will generate a manifest that can be used to manage all of 
.B Puppet's
directories and files and prints it to standard output. This can likewise be redirected to a file:
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --genmanifest > /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
.PP
.B Puppet
can also create user and group accounts for itself (one puppet group and one puppet user) if it is invoked as root with the --mkusers argument:
.PP
\h"4"$ puppetd --mkusers
.PP
.SH SIGNALS
The 
.B puppetd
and
.B puppetmasterd
executables catch some signals for special handling. Both daemons catch (SIGHUP), which forces the server to restart tself. Predictably, interrupt and terminate (SIGINT and SIGHUP) will shut down the server, whether it be an instance of 
.B puppetd
or
.B puppetmasterd.
.PP
Sending the SIGUSR1 signal to an instance of 
.B puppetd
will cause it to immediately begin a new configuration transaction with the server. This signal has no effect on 
.B puppetmasterd.

.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html for
the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\'\-\-genconfig\'.

debug:       Enable full debugging.

help:        Print this help message


.TP
.B loadclasses: Load any stored classes. +puppetd+ caches configured
classes (usually at /etc/puppet/classes.txt), and setting
this option causes all of those classes to be set in your
+puppet+ manifest.


.TP
.B logdest:     Where to send messages. Choose between syslog, the console,
and a log file. Defaults to sending messages to the
console.

verbose:     Print extra information.
