.TH makedev.d 5 "1 June 2010" "Red Hat Linux" "Linux System Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
makedev.d \- configuration files for devices creation through MAKEDEV
.\".SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The behavior of
.B MAKEDEV
is instrumented by the configuration files in
.I /etc/makedev.d/
directory. They're read and "executed" by
.BR MAKEDEV(8)
on post installation of the MAKEDEV package.
.PP
These configuration file consists of a set of lines.
.PP
All empty lines, and all text on a line after a '#', will be ignored.
.PP
The remaining lines should all conform to one of the following formats:
.SH SYNTAX
This is a description of the four basic legal directives.
.TP
.B =NAME expanded text
this define a macro. eg: 
.I =BURNER   660 root cdwriter
will make 
.B MAKEDEV
expand
.I $BURNER
when encountered.
.TP
.B b mask owner group   major minor  minor_step dev_number root_name base
this directive define some
.I block
(``b'') device(s) creation.  They will be owned by
.I owner
and
.I group
and will have the
.I major
and
.I minor
as major and minor numbers.
.br
The
.I dev_number
arguments define how many devices will be created. If 
.I dev_number
is different from 1, then
.I dev_number
devices will be created, their minor number being incremented by
.I minor_step
at each step.
.br
If only one device is created, it will be named \fIroot_name\fP.  Else,
the devices will be named with regards to the following rules :
.RS 7
.IP \(bu
If 
.I root_name
does not contains ``%d'', then ```\fI%d\fP'' is appended to its end.
.IP \(bu
If 
.I base
is not set, it is initialized to zero.
.IP \(bu
Then, at each step, the name of the device we have to created is obtained
by incrementing
.I base
and replacing ``%d'' by \fI base\fP. This is equivament to these statements :
.NF
$base++; $file = sprintf($name, $base);
.FI
.\" If several devices have to be created and if 
.RE
.TP
.B c mask owner group   major minor  minor_step dev_number root_name base
is quite the same directive as the previous one, exept its purpose is
.I character
devices (``c'') creation.
.TP
.B l destination source
will make
.B makdev
symlink
.I source
on \fIdestination\fP.
.\" .TP
.\" .B s mask owner group root_name
.\" will make
.\" .B makdev
.\" creating a node like the \fBb\fP and the \fBc\fP directives, but as a regular
.\" file with the sticky bit positionned.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
Since there is currently no standardization in what names are used for
system users and groups, it is possible that you may need to modify
\fBMAKEDEV\fR's configuration files to reflect your site's settings.
.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
# /etc/makedev.d/test sample
#

# the following line create (```\fBc\fP'') the famous \fI/dev/null\fP entry
# with 666 mask (file access permissions), with 1 as major and
# 3 as minor
c 666 root root         1   3  1  1 null


# the following line define the STORAGE macro that specify a 660
# mask for file permissions, root as owner and disk as group
=STORAGE  660 root disk

# the following line create 16 \fI/dev/hdaX\fP entries (/dev/hda0 to
# /dev/hda15) with the permissions and ownership defined above,
# and with 22 as major
b $STORAGE             22   0  1 16 hda%d

# this one link /dev/snd on alsa entry in procfs
# (usually mounted in /proc)
l snd ../proc/asound/dev
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP
.SH NOTES
The name of the file may contain some ``\fI/\fP'' characters :
.B makdev
will create the necessary directories if the node to create must be
in a sub directory.
.br
Comments must begin on first line character.
.br
Files are parsed one by one, after having been sorted by name in alphabetical order.
.SH FILES
The
.IR /etc/makedev.d/*
files contains instructions that instrument
.B makdev
to create the device files in /dev.  Especially,
.IR /etc/makedev.d/00macros
define most frequently used macros.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
Linux Allocated Devices
.br
It can be found in
.IR /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-<VERSION>/Documentation/devices.txt
if the kernel-doc package is installed. <VERSION> is the version number
of the installed kernel (eg: 2.6.32).
